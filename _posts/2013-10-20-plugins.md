Plugins are code that can be loaded into your build rules to define new tasks or settings. Usually they add support for a specific language or tool. For example, to load support for mocha (a javascript test system):

```coffeescript
load "mocha"
```

The `load` function works just like node's `require` function, with a few twists:

- The plugin name is prefixed with "plz-", so the module name for "mocha" is "plz-mocha".
- Before checking normal node paths, plz will check:
    - `$HOME/.plz/plugins` -- where `$HOME` is your home folder
    - `$PROJECT/.plz/plugins` -- where `$PROJECT` is the folder where the plz rules file was found
    - the environment variable `PLZ_PATH` if it's defined
- Any exports from the module are discarded.

The plugin may be written in either javascript or coffee-script.

Plugins are executed in the same namespace as the build script, so they can
modify globals. (This is unusual in coffeescript, but normal in javascript.)

A module can define multiple plugins by assigning functions to the global `plugin` object. For example, this module defines two plugins, "c++" and "c--":

```coffeescript
plugins["c++"] = ->
  task "build", ->
    exec "g++ ..."

plugins["c--"] = ->
  task "build", ->
    exec "g-- ..."
```

When loading a plugin by name, plz will first check if there's an entry in the global `plugins` object of that name, and if so, it will just call that function. Otherwise, it will load the "plz-(name)" module according to the rules above. Then it will check again for a `plugins` function and call it if it exists, in case the loaded module just added a few new plugins to the global object.

A couple of plugins are built-in, as demos and to handle common tasks.


## <a name="mocha"></a> Mocha

https://github.com/robey/plz/blob/master/plz-builtins/src/plugins/mocha.coffee

[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) is a unit test system for javascript & coffee-script. The plz mocha plugin attaches to the "test" task, watches for any source or test-source changes, and runs the mocha binary.

The `settings` object gets a `mocha` sub-object with the following settings:

- `bin: "./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha"` -- where is mocha installed in this project?
- `source: "./lib"` -- where does javascript source live?
- `testSource: "./test"` -- where does test source live?
- `display: "spec"` -- which mocha display engine should it use?
- `grep: null` -- what (if anything) should be passed to `--grep`?
- `options: [ "--colors" ]` -- what other options should be passed?

Because all settings can be specified on the command-line, here's one way to run only the tests with "brick" in their name, using the "nyan-cat" display enigne:

```bash
$ plz test mocha.display=nyan mocha.grep=brick
```

To specify that your test source lives in `src/test/`, you would add a line like this to `build.plz`:

```coffeescript
settings.mocha.testSource = "./src/test"
```


## <a name="coffee-script"></a> Coffee-script

https://github.com/robey/plz/blob/master/plz-builtins/src/plugins/coffeescript.coffee

If the coffee-script plugin ("coffee") is loaded:

- the project type is changed to "coffee"
- a task is attached to "build" which watches `*.coffee` files in the source folder, compiles them with the coffee-script compiler, and places them into the target folder
- the coffee-script compiler is added to mocha's command-line options
- `*.coffee` is added to the file watches for the "test" task

The `settings` object gets a `coffee` sub-object with the following settings:

- `bin: "./node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee"` -- where is the coffee-script compiler installed in this project?
- `target: "./lib"` -- where should compiled javascript live?
- `source: "./src"` -- where is the coffee-script source found?
- `options: []` -- what other options should be passed to the compiler?

For example, to have the compiled javascript placed in `build/`, you would add a line like this to `build.plz`:

```coffeescript
settings.coffee.target = "./build"
```
