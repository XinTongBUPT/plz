Plz is a script automation system like "make", "rake", and "cake". It aims to make simple tasks trivial, and difficult tasks easier. Highlights:

- **Fast.** Rules are written in javascript or coffee-script and executed by the v8 engine. Your build could be finished before other build systems even launch.
- **Clean.** No console spew. The default logging level runs silent unless there's an error.
- **Simple.** Most of the basic shell commands are exposed as global functions via [shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs), or just call "exec". You don't have to learn a new syntax for copying files.
- **Powerful.** Tasks can be executed by name, or automatically when files change, based on glob patterns. Plugins are easy to write, and can attach new features to existing tasks.

When tasks are triggered by watching for changed files, dependencies become automatic, and less "manual wiring" is required. It adds surprising leverage.

Why does this even exist?

"Make" is 1000 years old, and somehow still the gold standard of build automation. "Ant" was an embarrassment; "Maven" thought maybe the problem with ant was that it didn't have enough bureaucracy; both conflate builds with package management. The high-level language world is on the right track with things like "rake" and "cake", but they aren't flexible enough to grow with you when you need to do more than just run a few shell commands.

You should be able to write some simple rules to describe how to build your library or app or website, and those rules shouldn't require you to learn a new language. It should be basically a list of shell commands, with some javascript/coffeescript code if you want to get fancy, and it should run automatically when watched files are changed.

In short, you should be able to automate command pipelines without getting bogged down in "frameworks" or trying to figure out how to read an environment variable or copy a file from inside lisp or java. Shell commands have been able to do this -- and so have you -- since you were a kitten.

Plz is an attempt to go back to basics, and just do the simplest thing that could possibly work. No magic.


## <a name="example"></a> Example

Here's a sample `build.plz` rules file that says:

- For any changed (or new) `*.jpg` file in `assets/original/`, run "shrink" against them to generate a smaller image, and put the result in `assets/icons/`.
- For any changed file in `assets/`, restart the local web server.
- To clean build products, erase everything in `assets/icons/`.

{% include code-header.html name="intro-sample" %}
{% include code/intro-sample-js.md %}
{% include code-middle.html name="intro-sample" %}
{% include code/intro-sample-coffee.md %}
{% include code-footer.html name="intro-sample" %}

If you modified some images, and ran "plz" afterward, it would generate new icons and restart your local web server. If you ran "plz -w" (watch mode), it would do this every time you saved an image.
